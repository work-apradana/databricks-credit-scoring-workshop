# Credit Scoring Workshop Dashboards

This directory contains the dashboard JSON file for the Databricks Credit Scoring Workshop. These dashboards are designed to visualize key metrics and insights related to credit scoring, loan performance, and customer behavior. The dashboards can be imported into your Databricks workspace and customized as needed.

Note that I built this dashboard almost entirely using **Dashboard Authoring Agent** in Databricks. You may want to try the agent to experience AI-assisted dashboard creation!
